# Goals

The next goals for the project are right now:

1. Change it into being able to have multiple styles at once (which might overlap)
    1. Make masks into list
    2. Make lists into tensors    
    3. Make sure the that "layer_mask" (label in Oliver's Code) is updated correctly    
    4. Change loss fuction to sum over loss function

2. Turn this into an API such that you can use in an easy way + move into one source folder
    1. class: training
    2. class: mask generator (circular, rectangle, etc.)

3. Test if masks without only 1 and 0 also work

4. Play around and create some fun images

5. If we like that, approaching students at Tisch for a possible "collaboration"/dialog
